# UFOs

## Project Overview

Gathers data on UFO sightings and displays them in a filterable table on a webpage; the table is primarily built in JavaScript using the D3 library, with the webpage built using stylings from Bootstrap. A JS file containing the data as an array of objects that store the date, city, state, country, UFO shape, duration of sighting, and comment was loaded, with the date, city, state, country and shape being used for for filter fields. Three functions are used for the table: one to build the table, one to update the filter values based on users inputting text into the filter fields, and a last function that uses the filter fields to rebuild the table.

## Results

The webpage was built to scale appropriately with the user's viewport and begins with a short introduction before displaying the table:

Filters are applied when the user enters text into one of the input fields and updates automatically if the field is deselected by clicking off of it, or by pressing the enter key or tab to select the next input.

The filter is percise and requires the format to be exactly in the form suggested by the placeholder text; partial text does not give results, and words must be completely lowercase.

The filter can use multiple fields to narrow down results even further, such as checking how many sightings were in a specific city on a certain date.

## Summary

The filter system for the current version of the webpage is both unintuitive and inflexible. Since the page only accepts exact entries and doesn't change dynamically with each keystroke it doesn't appear the filters even function until a user clicks out of the fields or presses enter; updating the filters by pressing a button is a visible signal to the user when they can expect the table to update. The one advantage to the current design is that users might start with a broad search and use the result to narrow further, where the result updating with each field gives a natural pause for browsing the table to find the next filter term.

To address both categories of flaws, filtering that updates with each inputted character would be far superior however. The first change to the design would be to make the fields case-insensitive; applying `toLowerCase()` to the filter values generated by the user would fix this. The next change is using the user input as a partial search term, taking the input as the beginning of a string that ends with a wild search character.

One further change is to write out a message if there are no term that match the input to inform the user that no results were found. In the current form a non-match gives nothing, which can potentially give the impression that the filter function is broken instead of the lack of results.
